## What is this

This notebook will include informal meta-analyses of different metrics and methods
for evaluating surgical skill.


>**The reported metrics compare differences between novices and expert surgeons.**


It is informal because it's not based on systematic review,
and because some studies have been included with very relaxed conditions. For example,
I have picked the novices and experts without comparing their definitions between studies. 
Novice = weakest skill group in the study, expert = strongest skill group in the study.
If a study included more than 2 groups, I picked the weakest (=novice) and strongest (=expert)
groups' results and discarded the others. If a study included more than 1 task, or several sub-tasks, I picked the one with largest difference between groups.

**Many papers did report means and standard deviations explicitly, so they had to be estimated from boxplots/barplots, or by some other means**

For example, sometimes studies reported only mean or median, but no SE/SD. I estimated the SD/SE in those cases based e.g. on the SD of some other similar metric that they reported, or the SD of previous results for the same metric. **See the excel file for notes on each study.**

May or may not be turned into more systematic meta-analysis later.

Example metrics that will be most likely included (Bolded ones have priority)

- **Task time**
- **Tool Path length**
- Tool Velocity
- Tool Acceleration
- Tool Curvature
- **Idle time**
- **Pupil dilations**
- **Blinks**
- **Tool Movement efficiency**
- **Number of movements**
- Tool Forces
- Tool Torques
- **Bimanual dexterity**
- **Jerk**
- Fixation duration
- Saccade amplitudes
- EEG?

Full list of papers and metrics can be found in the excel file shared in the repo:

## How results are calculated

1. From each study, extract
  + Number of trials per group (Nn, Ne, for novices and experts, respectively)
  + Means per group (Mn, Me for novices and experts, respectively)
  + Standard deviations per group (SDn, SDe)
2. Calculate pooled standard deviation SDpooled
3. Normalize by calculating Standardized Mean Difference (SDM): (Mn - Me)/SDpooled
4. Calculate small sample size correction g = SMD*(1 - 3/(4n - 9)), where n is the total sample size of the study (both groups combined).
5. Calculate SDg, standard deviation after correction

These values are used as input in the R *meta* package's metagen function.
